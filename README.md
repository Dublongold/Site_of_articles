This is my first application created using C#, ASP.NET. Since I didn't want to use a good frontend because I only wanted to create a good backend, the frontend looks bad. And, for some unknown reason, some features don't work (either I didn't fix the problems, or the Entity Framework Core API was changed, or I changed SQL from MySQL to Microsoft SQL (or vice versa) and didn't test it).
