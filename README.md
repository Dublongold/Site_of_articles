This is my first application created using C#, ASP.NET. Since I didn't want to use a good frontend because I only wanted to create a good backend, the frontend looks bad. And, due unknown reason, some features don't work (or I didn't fix issues, or Entity Framework Core API was changed, or I was changed SQL from MySQL to Microsoft SQL (or vice versa) and didn't tested).
